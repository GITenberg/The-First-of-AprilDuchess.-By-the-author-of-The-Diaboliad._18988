<h2>DEDICATION</h2>

<h3>TO A</h3>

<h2>CELEBRATED DUTCHESS.</h2>


<p>MADAM,</p>

<p>I am rather apprehensive that you will rank me among the Impertinents of
the Age, in giving a performance which treats professedly of the
Triumphs of Folly, the Sanction of Your Grace. But tho', in the too
great quickness of apprehension, this may be the case; I have not the
least doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span> but, in some succeeding moments of coolness and candour,
you will accompany me through this Address; and not suffer a condemning
spirit to pass a final sentence upon me, without giving some little
attention to my justification.</p>

<p>I need not tell Your Grace, that, in former times, every Family of
Distinction was considered as incomplete in its establishment, if it did
not possess a certain whimsical Character called a <i>Fool</i>; who was
either to afford amusement to his witty Master by the real singularity
of his Humour,&mdash;or to act as a foil to his foolish Lord by well-timed
displays of affected Folly.&mdash;These appendages to Greatness have long
been laid aside.&mdash;Indeed, the present Age, which is remarkable for its
refinements, has, in the general methods of forming the Great, blended
the two Characters;&mdash;and it does not seldom happen, as Your Grace very
well knows, that a Modern Man of Fashion serves his Company both as
their <i>Host</i> and their <i>Buffoon</i>. I cannot therefore, in justice, be
considered as guilty of any impropriety in addressing this work to Your
Grace, as it relates to a Personage, who has heretofore possessed, as it
were, a domestic union with the Great, by furnishing, from among her
Children, the <i>chief Wits</i> of their noble Houses.</p>

<p>Tho' it has changed its appearance, the connection has not ceased to
subsist; and <span class="smcap">Folly</span>, though she extends her influence over all ranks and
professions, still seems more particularly attached to the higher Orders
of Life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Folly</span> loves the Toilette of a Woman of Fashion!&mdash;It is her Altar.&mdash;The
enormity of its expences,&mdash;the frivolousness, to say no worse, of its
conversation,&mdash;and the time which is lost in attending its duties, are
so many offerings to her honour. The love of display is inherent in her
nature:&mdash;every place of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span> public amusement is, more or less, her
delight;&mdash;but an <i>Opera</i> is her favourite entertainment.&mdash;There, she not
only presides, but triumphs.&mdash;There, Sense, Taste, and Reason, lie
beneath her Feet.</p>

<p>As she is now become your intimate companion, I will not mortify Your
Grace with the history of her origin, and an account of her genealogy,
which I am sure would greatly distress you. Believe me, Madam, I should
be sorry to give you a moment's mortification. My sincere desire is to
do you good, by warning you of the danger which awaits such a
disgraceful connection.</p>

<p>At your time of life it is not wholly unnatural that you should find
something pleasant in the frolic gaiety of your Friend; and the
Flatterers, who are alike under her influence, may find something
graceful in the manners which she might communicate to you: but in the
Mirror of Wisdom, the highest beauties of <span class="smcap">Folly</span> appear but as foul
deformities; and she is there seen in her natural appearance, attended
by Vice, Contempt, and Misery.</p>

<p><i>The Prosperity of Fools</i>, says the Wise Man, <i>shall destroy them</i>. The
influence of <span class="smcap">Folly</span> is more dangerous, as the station it possesses is
more exalted; and as the means of doing good are more enlarged among the
Rich and Great, that time is the more to be lamented which they consume
in frivolous pursuits and empty pleasures.</p>

<p>Without intruding upon your recollection the more awful obligations
attendant upon your station in the world, you will forgive me if I just
hint to Your Grace that Society has claims upon you, which you cannot
refuse but with dishonour to yourself, and the contempt of those who
possess the right which you refuse to grant; a contempt which they will
not fail to bestow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>Give then to Society what it requires&mdash;a great and noble example of
<i>female excellence</i>.&mdash;Discard your present Associate;&mdash;cultivate the
more solid Graces;&mdash;exalt your character by the dignity of Virtue;&mdash;and
let continual actions of Benevolence and Generosity mark those hours
which are passing hastily away, and will never return.</p>

<p>Should Your Grace honour the following Poem, if it may deserve that
name, with a perusal, you will, perhaps, consider me as a visionary
Character.&mdash;Be that as it may,&mdash;I am quite awake to your Honour and
Interest in the Counsels I have given you; and if your Grace should
adopt them, you will awake also.&mdash;The Visions of Folly will vanish
away;&mdash;and your eyes will open on the real prospect of wise and
honourable days.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I am, Madam, with all due respect,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Your Grace's most sincere Friend,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And humble Servant,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">* *&nbsp; &nbsp; * * *.</span><br />

<h2>FIRST OF APRIL.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas on the Morn when <i>April</i> doth appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wets the Primrose with its maiden tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas on the Morn when laughing <span class="smcap">Folly</span> rules,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calls her Sons around, and dubs them Fools;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bids them be bold, some untry'd path explore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do such deeds as Fools ne'er did before;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas on that Morn, when Fancy took her stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside my couch, and, with fantastic wand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wav'd, from her airy cells, the Antic Train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That play their gay delusions on the brain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strait, methought, a rude impetuous Throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With noise and riot, hurried me along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where a sumptuous Building met my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose gilded turrets seem'd to dare the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To every Wind it op'd an ample door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every Wind tumultuous thousands pour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these I enter'd a stupendous Hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scene of some approaching festival.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the wide portals, full in sight, were spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banners of yellow hue, bestrip'd with red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon, in golden characters, were seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The Anniversary of Folly's Queen</span>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange motley ornaments the Building grac'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every emblem of corrupted Taste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stately Column rose to meet the Dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Sculpture borrow'd from the Arts of Rome;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<span class="i0">No well-wrought Frieze crept graceful on the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' <i>Acanthus</i> weav'd no splendid Capitals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did the Attic elegance supply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One simple foliage for the judging eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, in their stead, Confusion void of Sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the pride of false Magnificence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Display'd an idle, vain, fantastic show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit only for the Crowd that gaz'd below.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Gay China's unsubstantial forms supply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place of Beauty, Strength, Simplicity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each varied colour, of the brightest hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green, the red, the yellow, and the blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every part the dazzled eyes behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here streak'd with silver, there enrich'd with gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While fancied forms upon the ceiling sprawl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shapeless monsters decorate the wall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">In every scatter'd niche I look'd in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Heroes famous on th' embattled plain;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or animated Bust, whose brow severe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark'd the sage Statesman or Philosopher.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the place of those whose Patriot fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave glory to the Greek and Roman name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Heroes who for Freedom bravely fought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men without heads,&mdash;and Heads that' never thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greet my sick eye,&mdash;with all their names enroll'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the vain pomp of prostituted gold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Nor had the Painter's active hand restrain'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The all-bedaubing brush: the walls were stain'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the gay colourings of capricious Art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein nor Truth nor Genius bore a part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There <i>Sigismunda</i>'s form again I knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which <span class="smcap">Folly</span> hinted, and old <i>Hogarth</i> drew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sketch of <span class="smcap">Reynold</span>'s pencil did appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Science and Taste found no admittance there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the vain Painter had essay'd to trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In rude distortion, and with strange grimace,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Each story the Historic Pages tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where <span class="smcap">Folly</span> triumph'd, and where <span class="smcap">Wisdom</span> fell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There the great <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, whose sagacious eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierc'd through the gloom of dark Philosophy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the World unveil'd her awful face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crouch'd a low, servile Courtier in disgrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There <span class="smcap">Pulteney</span>, who the first stout bulwark stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of British Freedom 'gainst the torrent flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dire Corruption, having stemm'd the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook off the Patriot, and became the Slave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There <span class="smcap">Pitt</span>, whose great and comprehensive soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No threats could frighten, no events controul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose name dash'd terror on his Country's foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From <span class="smcap">Gallia's</span> Shores to where the <span class="smcap">Ganges</span> flows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Eastern Nations;&mdash;There he wore the chain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Royal Gold, and join'd the pension'd Train.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Muse weeps, and drops the silent tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the sad truths which were recorded there.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i2">High, in the midst, a Pageant of a Throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the extreme of Tinsel Splendor shone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Sacred Ensigns, no Imperial Chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark'd the high worth of those who counseled there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, shaded by a Curtain's vivid green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A splendid, soft, luxuriant Couch was seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spangled Banners glitter'd all around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the unfolded Silver strew'd the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the false Mirrors pain the dazzled eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mingled Forms, and gay Perplexity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung from the roof by many a golden thread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Canopy its airy cov'ring spread,<br /></span>

<div class="sidenote">&#9129;</div>
<span class="i0">'Mid the green woodlands of a Western Spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the Throne a splendid Altar stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inlaid, in curious forms, with fragrant wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon the faithful Votaries might lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their Offerings sacred to the festal day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Methought, that, tir'd of the disgusting scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit for Fools only, and their silly Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought in haste to leave the inglorious Throng:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as the pressing Crowd my steps prolong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deafening Cymbals, and the noisy brawl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pealing Laughter, ecchoed round the Hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strait a troop of dancing Youths appear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rosy hue, by friendly <span class="smcap">Bacchus</span> chear'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tinkling bells upon their feet they wore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each, in his hand, a rural Tabor bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sides they frequent beat, and, at the sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft in air, with, antic step, they bound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Next came a blooming Boy in robe of green;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon a Bull he rode, whose horns were gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a golden flower and budding spray.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Around him every vernal Songster fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the Lark soar'd and whistled o'er his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now he smil'd with joy, and now, apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crystal tears bedew'd his alter'd face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the young Fondling on his Mother's breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who cries for absent joys, and thinks them best:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid smiles, and tears, and frowns, he onward came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gentle pace,&mdash;and <span class="smcap">April</span> was his name.<br /></span>

example of the good effects of <i>a prudential</i> and <i>parsimonious</i>
education, the moment she was let loose, run into the extreme of Folly
and expensive Fashions.&mdash;It has been said of one of her sisters, that
she never spoke before her marriage, and was never silent

Election, it was consider'd as a certain road to success by the
Patriotic Candidates for the Senatorial Dignity, to propose and take
oaths to support certain <i>wise</i> measures, and to endeavour at the Repeal
of certain <i>dangerous</i> Laws. This person was among the outrageous
Partisans of Opposition, who, at that time, look the propos'd oaths with
great noise and clamour in various parts of the Kingdom: But his success
was not then equal to that which he has since found, without any <i>public
engagements</i>, beneath the smile of Ministerial favour.&mdash;But I do not
mean, indeed I have no right to express myself with severity at this
change of Party;&mdash;I will not add <i>Sentiments</i>;&mdash;for they are in the
secret recesses of his own breast.&mdash;Nor shall I endeavour, at present,
to develope the turnings and windings of that course which many of our
Modern Patriots have taken.&mdash;These things will, in due time, explain
themselves.&mdash;The Right Honourable Captain fought and found an empty
Renown among the Frozen Seas of the <i>North</i>.&mdash;Some more substantial
Honours seem to await him here.&mdash;I do not despair of seeing him <i>a Lord
of the Admiralty</i>.&mdash;The Noble Relation to whom he owes the rudiments of
naval wisdom, may also have communicated to him that subtle Spirit,
which, in spite of Private Connections, Family Dissentions, Public
Engagements, and Ministerial Confusion, looks alone to, and will
maintain its own Interests.</p></div>

Parent to his Children;&mdash;and, being repulsed in this hope, made the
basest resolutions, but possess'd not sufficient courage to put them in
execution.&mdash;And his reward is <i>Disappointment for Life</i>.

and are too mean to be long the topics of any conversion, is drawing
aside the veil where it ought to be covered with thicker folds.&mdash;But
when the mean Character, conscious of the universal contempt of those in
his own rank, endeavours, by occasional smiles, and a silky demeanour,
to acquire some degree of respect from the subordinate stations, his
hopes, surely, ought to be dash'd;&mdash;and he deserves well of Society and
of Virtue who performs the office.&mdash;Tho', I believe, in the <i>Character
before me</i>, the <i>gentle</i> semblance of Virtue will not pass current with
those who possess the least suspicion, or the most ordinary
penetration.&mdash;<i>But more of this hereafter.</i></p></div>

material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
